## Techs

This project was developed with following technologies:

- [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/HTML)
- [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/JavaScript)

## Project

This project simulates a purchase process in a web store, the Fake Store.
I used the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/) to fetch and mock data.

### Requirements and functionalities

**Rendering dinamic informations:**

- Application creates a menu list based on products categories;
- Application show indicators like: amount products on cart list, and witch category is selected.
- Application allows to order products by price: low to high and vice versa;
- In the **Cart** section, the application allows increment and decrement the product amount as well delete a product from cart;
- In the **Cart** section, the application calculates and updates the values dinamically;
- Application handles the fact that the cart is empty;
- It is possible to return to buy more products during cart manipulation.

**UI/UX aspects:**

- Users can view all products or products by category;
- There are functions and elements to allow fluid navigation between sections;

## Layout

I used Figma to build design.

## Learn

It was a big challenge to build an application like this without using frameworks/libs. But it was done on purpose, to further consolidate my basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Also, I want to build the same application using React.js, Next.js, and Redux.
It will be really cool to be able to compare these aspects of development and actually experience the benefits that using frameworks/libs bring.

This project is not yet complete. I like to refactor my designs as I gain more knowledge.
